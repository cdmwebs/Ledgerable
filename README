## Ledgerable

Ledgerable aims to be a *simple* personal finance tracking tool. Enter your transactions as you see fit, schedule transactions, or make recurring transactions. Easy peasey.

Currently, you'll need to load up the console and create a User for yourself. Then you'll need to load the DB schema via `rake db:load:schema`.
Load Ledgerable via `rails start` blah blah blah.

The rest, I hope, is self explanatory.

Oh yeah, I'm sure the tests are nuked. I should probably be better about that.

Pull requests encouraged!
